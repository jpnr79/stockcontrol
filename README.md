# stockcontrol
A Stock Control Plugin for GLPI

I am experimenting with writing plugins for GLPI so strongly suggest you don't use this repository.  It is in NO way ready for deployment

The main purpose is to allow:
    1) receipting multiple consumables with similar data (e.g. when you order 10 cables on the same order on the same invoice) rather than having to enter all details 10 times
    2) running stock control reports saying whay needs ordering / checking
    
    
    I'm sure other functionality will appear when I get this finished!
